# Movie-Guide
This project is a Movie Guide web application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to search for movies, view basic movie details, and display trending movies. It fetches movie data from a public API like The Movie Database (TMDb).
Key Features:
Search Movies: Users can search for movies by title.
Trending Movies: Displays a list of trending or popular movies.
Movie Details: Shows information about the selected movie, including title, release date, rating, and overview.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
API: TMDb API or similar movie database API (use your own API key)
Design: Simple, minimalist UI built with CSS.
How It Works:
The app makes API requests to fetch movie data, including search results and trending movie lists.
Users can type in a movie title to search for relevant movies.
Each movie card displays basic information like title, release year, and rating.
Clicking on a movie shows more detailed information (e.g., plot summary, genres).
Movie data is dynamically updated and rendered in the UI using JavaScript.
Instructions to Run:
Open index.html in your web browser.
To make API calls work, replace the API key in the JavaScript file with your own TMDb API key.
Explore the search and trending features to browse movies.
Future Enhancements:
Add filters (e.g., genre, year) to refine search results.
Pagination for large search results.
Implement a "favorites" feature to allow users to save their favorite movies.
Dark mode theme toggle.
API:
The movie data is fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. You can create a free account and get an API key to fetch movie data.
